# Stone Removal Game

Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing stones from a pile, with Alice going first.

- Alice starts by removing exactly `10` stones on her first turn.
- For each subsequent turn, each player removes exactly `1` fewer stone than the previous opponent.

The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`, return `true` if Alice wins the game and `false` otherwise.

## Example 1:

> **Input:** n = 12
> **Output:** true
>
> **Explanation:** Alice removes 10 stones, leaving 2 stones for Bob. Bob cannot remove 9 stones, so Alice wins.

## Example 2:

> **Input:** n = 1
> **Output:** false
>
> **Explanation:** Alice cannot remove 10 stones, so Alice loses.

## Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 50`

## Starter Code

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn can_alice_win(n: i32) -> bool {
        
    }
}
```
