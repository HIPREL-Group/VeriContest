# Minimum Operations to Make Columns Strictly Increasing

You are given a `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of non-negative integers.

In one operation, you can increment the value of any `grid[i][j]` by 1.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make all columns of `grid` strictly increasing.

## Example 1:

> **Input:** grid = [[3,2],[1,3],[3,4],[0,1]]
> **Output:** 15
> **Explanation:**
> - To make the 0th column strictly increasing, apply 3 operations on `grid[1][0]`, 2 operations on `grid[2][0]`, and 6 operations on `grid[3][0]`.
> - To make the 1st column strictly increasing, apply 4 operations on `grid[3][1]`.

## Example 2:

> **Input:** grid = [[3,2,1],[2,1,0],[1,2,3]]
> **Output:** 12
> **Explanation:**
> - To make the 0th column strictly increasing, apply 2 operations on `grid[1][0]` and 4 operations on `grid[2][0]`.
> - To make the 1st column strictly increasing, apply 2 operations on `grid[1][1]` and 2 operations on `grid[2][1]`.
> - To make the 2nd column strictly increasing, apply 2 operations on `grid[1][2]`.

## Constraints:

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] < 2500`

## Starter Code

```dafny
predicate minimum_operations_pre(grid: seq<seq<int>>)

predicate minimum_operations_post(grid: seq<seq<int>>, res: int)
  requires minimum_operations_pre(grid)

method minimum_operations(grid: seq<seq<int>>) returns (res: int)
  requires minimum_operations_pre(grid)
  ensures minimum_operations_post(grid, res)
```
