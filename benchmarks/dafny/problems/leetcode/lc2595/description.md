# Number of Even and Odd Bits

You are given a **positive** integer `n`.

Let `even` denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of `n` with value 1.

Let `odd` denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of `n` with value 1.

Note that bits are indexed from **right to left** in the binary representation of a number.

Return the array `[even, odd]`.

## Example 1:

> **Input:** n = 50
> **Output:** [1,2]
> **Explanation:**

The binary representation of 50 is `110010`.

It contains 1 on indices 1, 4, and 5.

## Example 2:

> **Input:** n = 2
> **Output:** [0,1]
> **Explanation:**

The binary representation of 2 is `10`.

It contains 1 only on index 1.

## Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 1000`

## Starter Code

```dafny
predicate even_odd_bit_pre(n: int)

predicate even_odd_bit_post(n: int, result: seq<int>)
  requires even_odd_bit_pre(n)

method even_odd_bit(n: int) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires even_odd_bit_pre(n)
  ensures even_odd_bit_post(n, result)
```
